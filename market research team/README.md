# AI Marketing Agency: Project Overview

This project is a **Multi-Agent System** that automates the creation of a marketing campaign for sunglasses. Instead of one AI doing everything, **4 specialized agents** work in a pipeline, passing their work to the next agent in line.

It uses **Google's Gemini 3 Pro** for reasoning and vision, and **Imagen 4** for high-fidelity image generation.

It simulates a real-world creative team led by a Project Manager:
`Manager (Orchestrator)` -> `Researcher` -> `Designer` -> `Copywriter` -> `Delivery Lead`

## The Workflow Pipeline

The `run_sunglasses_campaign_pipeline()` function acts as the **Manager/Orchestrator**. It holds the overall plan and distributes work to the agents in sequence:

### 1. 🕵️‍♂️ Market Research Agent (The "Analyst")
*   **Goal:** Find out what's trending and match it to your inventory.
*   **Model:** Gemini 3 Pro Preview.
*   **Type:** **Tool-Using Agent** (ReAct Pattern).
*   **How it works:**
    *   It operates with a goal: "Find summer sunglasses trends."
    *   It uses two tools:
        *   `tavily_search_tool`: To search the live internet for external trends.
        *   `product_catalog_tool`: To look up the internal `inventory.db` catalog.
    *   **Autonomy:** It decides *what* to search for and *when* to check the catalog, looping until it has enough info.
    *   **Output:** A text summary of trends + recommended products (e.g., "Aviators are in").

### 2. 🎨 Graphic Designer Agent (The "Creator")
*   **Goal:** Create a visual asset for the campaign.
*   **Model:** Gemini 3 Pro (Prompting) + Imagen 4 (Generation).
*   **Type:** **Chain** (Text-to-Image).
*   **How it works:**
    *   It takes the **Trend Summary** from Agent 1.
    *   **Step A:** Asks Gemini 3 Pro to write a detailed **Image Prompt**.
    *   **Step B:** Sends that prompt to **Imagen 4** (Google's latest image model) to create the actual `.png` file.
    *   **Output:** A path to the generated image file.

### 3. ✍️ Copywriter Agent (The "Storyteller")
*   **Goal:** Write a catchy slogan.
*   **Model:** Gemini 3 Pro Preview (Multimodal Vision).
*   **Type:** **Multimodal Agent**.
*   **How it works:**
    *   It receives the **Actual Image** generated by Agent 2.
    *   It "looks" at the image (using Gemini 3's advanced vision) *and* reads the **Trend Summary**.
    *   It writes a slogan that fits both the visual style and the market data.
    *   **Output:** A short quote (e.g., "Chase the Sun in Classic Gold") + a justification.

### 4. 📦 Packaging Agent (The "Publisher")
*   **Goal:** Compile everything into a report.
*   **Type:** **Formatting Agent**.
*   **How it works:**
    *   It takes the Raw Trends, the Image, and the Quote.
    *   It rewrites the trends to sound "Executive" (professional tone).
    *   It assembles a `Markdown` file with proper headers, the embedded image, and the quote.
    *   **Output:** A final `campaign_summary.md` file ready for review.

## Key Technical Concepts

1.  **Orchestration:** The main script (`market_research_agent.py`) coordinates the hand-offs. Agent 1's output becomes Agent 2's input.
2.  **Tool Use:** The agent isn't scripted to "Search for X." It is given a search tool and a catalog tool, and *it* writes the logic to use them to satisfy the request.
3.  **Multimodality:** The agents handle **Text**, **Code/Functions**, **Image Generation**, and **Image Vision**.
4.  **State Management (The Baton Pass):** The Orchestrator manages the state. It captures the output of Agent 1 (`trend_summary`), holds it, and passes it as an input argument to Agent 2 and Agent 3. This ensures that downstream agents (like the Copywriter) have context from the entire pipeline, not just the previous step.
5.  **Sequential Guardrails & Cost Efficiency:** The pipeline is designed to "fail fast." If the Designer fails to generate an image, the system detects the error and halts before calling the Copywriter. This prevents wasting API tokens (and money) on downstream tasks that cannot be completed to quality.

## File Structure
*   `market_research_agent.py`: The main logic containing the 4 agent definitions and the pipeline element.
*   `tools.py`: Contains the actual code for `tavily_search` and `product_catalog_tool`. The agents "call" these functions.
*   `utils.py`: Helper functions to print pretty logs to your terminal so you can see what's happening.
